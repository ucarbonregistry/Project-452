_____________
The Project titled “28 MW Biomass Based Grid Supply Power Project by Shree Chhatrapati Shahu
SSK Ltd., is situated in Taluka Kagal, District Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India, commissioned by
Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd. (MSEDCL).

The Purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (Bagasse)
and thereby reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid-based electricity
with biomass based renewable electricity. The electricity produced by the project is directly
contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of fossil power at grid. The
project activity is a 28 MW totalled installed capacity cogeneration project activity and displaces
the carbon intensive grid energy mix with a renewable, carbon neutral energy source, the project
activity reduces carbon dioxide emissions over the project life. Replicable technology,
environmental, and sustainable development benefits also result from the project activity. These
include: introducing efficient high pressure cogeneration technology to the Indian sugar industry;
reducing power shortages in the state of Maharashtra India; and, fostering sustainable economic
growth through promoting energy self-sufficiency and resource conservation in India’s sugarcane
industry.

In September 2015 the PP expanded the Sugar Factory from 4950 TCD to 7000 TCD, Co-generation
from 12.5 MW to 28 MW & Molasses based Distillery unit from 45 KLPD up to 60 KLPD. In July 2022
the PP was granted consent for expansion of the Sugar Factory from 7000 TCD to 10000 TCD by
the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and in Dec 2022 the PP was also granted consent for
expansion for Distillery unit from 60 KLPD to 340 KLPD and installation of dryer.
The project activity employs 28 MW aggregated generators along with two boilers of 60 TPH and
70 TPH with high pressure and temperature configuration.

The first commercial supply of power to the grid by this UCR project activity was established in
January 2013 however the crediting period is from 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2023

PRIOR HISTORY
_________________
The UCR project activity had been registered as a CDM project activity under the title: Shree
Chhatrapati Shahu RE Project (CDM Project ID 1297) by the PP.

CDM Registration Date 22/12/2006

CDM Crediting Period 01/04/2007 - 31/03/2014 (Fixed)

CERs Issued (MR Period 1) n/a (Project was rejected)

Hence the UCR project activity has never been issued voluntary carbon credits for the current 2016-
2023 vintage years and there is no double counting of the credits envisioned. Additionally, the same
will be stated in the undertaking provided in the Double Counting Avoidance Assurance Document
(DAA) by M/s. Shree Chhatrapati Shahu Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd.
